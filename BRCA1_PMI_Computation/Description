This folder contains the files for performing distributed Pointwise Mutual Information computation using PySpark for mutations of the BRCA1 gene discussed in the 264 research papers 
associated with this gene. Keep all these files in the same folder when running the Jupyter notebook. 

The files are:
1. PMI_Computation_BRCA1_Gene.ipynb : This is the Jupyter notebook that has the complete code for the computation
2. list_of_docs_BRCA1.csv : This is the list of BRCA1 gene mutations and their classes. 
3. training_text_BRCA1.txt : This text file contains the combined literature of 264 papers, each associated with one mutation of the BRCA1 gene.These papers have been 
taken from the training dataset provided by the Kaggle Competition organizers.
